# starter-stopwatch
A stopwatch created with Vanilla Javascript.
This stopwatch uses Date.now to get a reference for the time, and has a start, stop, and reset button.
Timer will display 0 preceding the number if minutes/seconds/milliseconds is less than 10.
It accounts for a glitch in stopwatch functionality that would otherwise occur by someone clicking the start button repeatedly.
